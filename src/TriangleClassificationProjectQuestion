**Triangle Classification Project**
This project aims to develop a program that determines the type of a triangle
based on the three side lengths entered by the user. A triangle can be
classified as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene depending on its side lengths.

---

**Program Description**
1. Read the first side length of the triangle from the user.
2. Read the second side length of the triangle from the user.
3. Read the third side length of the triangle from the user.
4. Determine the type and validity of the triangle based on the entered side
lengths.
5. Display a message in the console that includes the determined triangle
type and validity status.

**Triangle Types and Validity**
- **Valid Triangle:** Any side must be shorter than the sum of the other two
sides and longer than their difference.
- **Equilateral Triangle:** All three sides are of equal length.
- **Isosceles Triangle:** Two sides are of equal length, and the third side
is of a different length.
- **Scalene Triangle:** All three sides have different lengths.
- **Invalid Triangle:** The given side lengths do not form a valid triangle.

**Key Notes**
This program determines the type and validity of a triangle based on the
three side lengths entered by the user and displays the result in the console.
If the user provides side lengths that do not form a valid triangle or do not
match the criteria for the specified types, an appropriate error message is
shown.
